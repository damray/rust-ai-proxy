# üß† Rust AI Proxy with Palo Alto AIRS + Ollama + OpenWebUI

![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)

This project is a secure AI reverse proxy written in Rust. It acts as a security buffer between:

* ‚úÖ The user (via OpenWebUI)
* üîí Palo Alto Networks AIRS (AI Runtime Security)
* üß† Ollama running local LLMs (e.g. LLaMA3)

It scans prompts and responses for threats in real time before sending them to the model or back to the user.

## Features

| Feature                     | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Prompt scanning           | Each user prompt is scanned via AIRS before being sent to the model  |
| ‚úÖ Response scanning         | Each LLM response is scanned before being forwarded to OpenWebUI     |
| üîÅ Transparent forwarding   | All other API calls are transparently proxied to Ollama              |
| üîê Security-aware responses | Blocks malicious, toxic or sensitive content based on AIRS detection |
| üê≥ Dockerized               | Fully containerized with support for corporate CA certificates       |
| ‚úÖ Log                      | Every Prompt scanned and Response are logged locally for demo and TS |

## Tech stack

* `Rust` + `axum` ‚Äî async web server / router
* `reqwest` ‚Äî for outgoing API calls to AIRS and Ollama
* `serde` / `serde_json` ‚Äî for JSON serialization
* `tokio` ‚Äî async runtime
* `tower_http` ‚Äî HTTP logging

## How it works

```text
[User via OpenWebUI] ‚ûú [Rust Proxy] ‚ûú (Prompt scanned by AIRS) ‚ûú [Ollama] ‚ûú (Response scanned by AIRS) ‚ûú [OpenWebUI display]
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

| Variable            | Required | Description                    |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `PANW_X_PAN_TOKEN`  | ‚úÖ        | API token for AIRS             |
| `PANW_PROFILE_ID`   | ‚úÖ        | Security profile ID for AIRS   |
| `PANW_PROFILE_NAME` | ‚úÖ        | Security profile name for AIRS |

You have to create a `.env` file to define these locally. Please create the file with value :
PANW_X_PAN_TOKEN=[YOUR TOKEN]
PANW_PROFILE_ID=[Retrieve your Profile ID in SCM]
PANW_PROFILE_NAME=[The profile name created by you]

## üê≥ Running with Docker (Step-by-step)

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/rust-ai-proxy.git
cd rust-ai-proxy
```

### 2. Prepare your `.env` file

Create a `.env` file at the root with:

```bash
PANW_X_PAN_TOKEN=your-token-here
PANW_PROFILE_ID=your-profile-id
PANW_PROFILE_NAME=your-profile-name
```

### 3. Add your CA certificate if required

If your network uses TLS inspection, Please change of networks. I didnt have the time for the moment to accept any TLS inspection inside CARGO during the compilation.


### 4. Build the project with Docker

```bash
docker-compose build rust_ai_proxy
```

### 5. Launch the stack

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 6. Open your browser

Access OpenWebUI via:

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access OpenWebUI.

## Example AIRS Scan Result (blocked)

```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "message": "‚õî The answer has been blocked by AI Runtime Analysis.",
  "reason": "toxic_content",
  "suggestion": "Please modify your question and avoid any toxic_content"
}
```

---

## üì£ TODO

* [ ] Add retry & timeout policy for model and AIRS requests
* [ ] Add unit tests and error tracing
* [ ] Find the correct way to bypass the tls inspection during the cargo build to download prerequisite mod
